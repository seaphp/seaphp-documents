# Code of Conduct – Seattle PHP User Group

## Purpose

The Seattle PHP User Group (SeaPHP UG) is a volunteer-run [PHP](http://php.net/)
user group, and invites anyone with a desire to talk and learn about PHP and
related technologies to gather together, share their knowledge, and promote the
PHP community in the Seattle, WA, and Puget Sound area.

SeaPHP UG desires to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors as
possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of their professional or personal background
including education, experience, age, ability, gender, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, physical appearance, or religion.
We invite all those who participate in SeaPHP UG to help us in creating such an
environment.

This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the expectations of all who participate in
our group, as well as how we should respond to unacceptable behavior. We expect
participants will abide by this CoC in all community venues—whether online or
in-person—as well as in one-on-one communications as they pertain to group
business.

## Expectations

You are expected to:

* Behave professionally.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from any unacceptable behavior.

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in
our group. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public;
please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related
to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of
nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides);
deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or
recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical
contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. In addition, religious evangelism and 
discussion of related topics, as well as related distribution of religious 
literature of any nature is unwelcome.

Our expectation is that we will treat each other, and others our community
interacts with, with consideration, empathy, and respect. Our speech and behavior
will be guided by a desire to create and maintain an inclusive community purposed
towards sharing knowledge and encouraging enthusiasm for solving problems with PHP.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If
a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).

## Complaints

It is every community member's responsibility to notice, and attempt to intervene
or notify others, if unacceptable behaviors are occurring at a meeting or event.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can
contact the organizers at admins@seaphp.com, send a direct message to
[@seaphp](https://twitter.com/seaphp) on twitter, or speak to an organizer
in person at an event.

The current organizers are:

* Tessa Mero ([@TessaMero](https://twitter.com/TessaMero))
* Andrew Woods ([@awoods](https://twitter.com/awoods))
* Ian Maddox ([@IanAMaddox](https://twitter.com/IanAMaddox))
* Cory Fowler ([@cfowlerMSFT](https://twitter.com/cfowlerMSFT))
* Isaac Leinweber ([@isaacleinweber](https://twitter.com/isaacleinweber))
* Jeremy Lindblom ([@jeremeamia](https://twitter.com/jeremeamia))

If you have a complaint that involves an organizer, you can contact one of the
others in confidence. The group is the priority, and steps will be taken to
ensure the group is successful.

## Mailing List Etiquette

In addition to adhering to the CoC, we ask that you also adhere to the following
guidelines as they pertain to the mailing list.

* Do not send spam or advertisements.
* Do not use the mailing list for recruiting purposes. Recruiters may post job
  openings on the [message board](http://www.meetup.com/seaphp/messages/boards/)
  only. Recruiters may also announce job openings at the beginning of physical
  meetups as directed by the meetup host.
* Stay on topic and post constructive messages.
* Remember that your emails are sent to all subscribers and that they are
  archived and made publicly available [on the meetup.com
  website](http://www.meetup.com/seaphp/messages/archive/).
* Avoid sending large attachments.
* Do not quote messages that were sent to you by other people in private mail,
  unless agreed beforehand.
* Do not troll or flame.
* Consult the [How do I ask a good question?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
  guide from StackOverflow if you are unsure about a question. Remember to do
  some of your own research first before taking up other members' time.
